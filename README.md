# Portfolio: setup and mobile version skeleton

In this project, I will be creating a _Portfolio setup and mobile friendly skeleton_ repo. This will be done by first creating a feature branch then add a **README.md** file. The project will have a .gitignore file to ignore all unneccesary files together with two files for HTML and CSS.
